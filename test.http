  "message": "# Presenting to VCs - Innmind questions\r\n\r\nWhat difficulties did you face while pitching?\r\nWhen you start pitching just knowing the pitch by heart and making sure you don't miss anything. Also having answers to what VCs ask.\r\n\r\nHow did you deal with it?\r\n\r\nRehearse the pitch multiple times until you can do it fluently with passion. \r\nDon't pitch important investors at the beginning of the fund-raising process.\r\nWrite down the questions you didn't have answers for and get back to the VCs with answers.\r\nContinuously improve the deck and pitch with feedback.\r\nAsk for feedback from as many partners as possible.\r\n\r\nWhat advice would you give to startups?\r\n\r\nAlways use a designer! If your deck doesn't look good your business won't!\r\nDon't reinvent the wheel, search from some YouTube videos about how to build a deck or use something like SlideBean to build it. Keep the same structure.\r\nKeep it very very simple, try to explain everything like you're explaining to a 5 year old. Simplicity makes everything easy to read and understand.\r\nAnswer all basic questions easily: What you're building, how is it for and why do they need it.\r\n\r\nWhat are the main questions VCs ask?\r\n\r\nWhat's different about your product from the competitors?\r\nWhat's your go-to-market strategy?\r\nHow will the project make money?\r\nDetails about the team, token vesting, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do VCs look for when viewing startups?\r\n\r\nVCs will invest for making money, you need to show them how you're gonna grow the business or how the business will grow the token to a place where they can win. \r\nThink about the startup from their point of view, they need to minimise risks, the more you de-risked the business the better it is.\r\nTraction fixes all problems! If you have traction everything else is negotiable.",
